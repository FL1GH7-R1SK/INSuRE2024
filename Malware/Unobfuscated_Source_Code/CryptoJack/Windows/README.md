# CryptoJack - 1d8

Utilizes WinAPI to:

* Open clipboard & read data
* Grab name of current foreground window
	* If it's the name of a cryptocurrency wallet software (Electrum is hardcoded as of now), we proceed to change wallet contents
* Changes clipboard contents to a link to my blog (: (If it was an attacker, they'd change the clipboard contents to their own wallet address)
	* Assumes victim is about to make a transfer

The following MITRE ATT&CK techniques utilized:

* T1115 (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115/)
* T1010 (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010/)

## Todo

* Implement regex to verify that the contents of the clipboard are a wallet address before changing it
